iam divya and iam learning about git and iam learning some new commands now
iam modifying data and iam adding some extra data.
1. git init: initializing empty repo for git
2. git status: it says what branch iam currently on, any file(s) has been added/modified
3. git add: the file that we want to commit
4. git commit: it commits the files which have been added/modifies in git add
